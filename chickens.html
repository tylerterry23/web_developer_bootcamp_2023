      The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a> red
      junglefowl species that are originally from Southeast Asia.<br> They have also
      partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowls (the grey
      junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).<br> [1] Rooster and cock
      are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans
      keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
      eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting,
      which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat
      are broilers and for eggs are layers.

      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of
      within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade found
      in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
      Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern
      Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century BC,
      with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land
      between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
      III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century
      BC.[7][8]

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and
      an adult female is called a hen.[9][10] Other terms are: Biddy: a newly
      hatched chicken[11][12] Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
      Chick: a young chicken[13] Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand,
      informal)[14] Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]
      Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic
      varieties.[16] Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In
      the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22
      weeks of age.[18] Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States,
      dialectal)[19]

    <h2>Biology and habitat</h2>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social Behavior</h4>

    <h1>I AM H6</h1>
    <p>
      Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have
      been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result
      of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations,
      rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often
      express a preference to lay in the same location. Two or more hens may try
      to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small or one of
      the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to
      lay on top of each other. There is evidence that individual hens prefer to
      be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[41]
