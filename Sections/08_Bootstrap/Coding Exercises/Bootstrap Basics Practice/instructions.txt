Bootstrap Basics Practice
I've given you some starter markup in index.html.  Bootstrap is already included! Please add in the appropriate bootstrap classes according to these instructions:

Make the section a bootstrap container

Give the h1 white text, a dark background, and center-aligned text

Make the div an alert ('warning' color).  Set the role attribute to alert, for accessibility purposes!

Make the first button a green bootstrap button

Make the second button a red bootstrap button
