For...Of Practice
Let's practice using for...of. I've provided you with an array called numbers.  Please use a for...of loop to loop over it, and print out the square of each value (the number multiplied by itself).

NOTES:

1. Udemy's coding exercise platform does NOT support the ** operator.
2. You could accomplish this by using a while loop or a for loop, but please use a for...of loop! Unfortunately, I can't enforce the type of loop you use, but please I'm begging you to use a for...of.  I will hunt you down if you don't.  Thank you and have a great day!

Your output should look like this:

1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
