Our First Constants Exercise
Let's get some practice defining constants. In index.js, please define the following two variables:

Define a constant called boilingPointC and set it to 100. 

Define a second constant called boilingPointF and set it to 212. 

That's it!

(technically, I can't test that you are using const instead of let...so you're on the honor system here! DO THE RIGHT THING AND USE const!
