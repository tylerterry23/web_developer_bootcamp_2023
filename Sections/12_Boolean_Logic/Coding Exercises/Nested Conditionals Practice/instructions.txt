Nested Conditionals Practice
Time for something a little bit different. I've given you a nested conditional that uses a variable called num.  I would like for you to change the value of num to another number, so that "YOU GOT ME!" is printed out. Don't change anything other than the value of num!  Leave the conditional alone!
