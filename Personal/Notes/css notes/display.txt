Display property

The display property specifies the type of box used for an HTML element.

In HTML, the default display property value is taken from the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default style sheet. The default value in XML is inline, including SVG elements.

The display property is often used together with the value none to hide an element.

The display property:

none - The element is completely removed.
block - The element is displayed as a block-level element (like paragraphs and headers).
inline - The element is displayed as an inline-level element (like span).
inline-block - The element is displayed as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values.
