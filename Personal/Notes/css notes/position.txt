In css there are 5 different position values:

- static
- relative
- absolute
- fixed
- sticky


### Static
Static is the default position value. It means that the element will be positioned according to the normal flow of the document. It will not be affected by the top, bottom, left, right, z-index, or float properties.

### Relative
Relative is the same as static, except that once the element has been positioned, the top, bottom, left, and right properties can be used to adjust the position relative to where it would normally occur in the document.

### Absolute
Absolute is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (i.e., the nearest ancestor that is not static). If there is no positioned ancestor, it is placed relative to the initial containing block (i.e., the document body). Absolutely positioned elements can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins.

### Fixed
Fixed is positioned relative to the initial containing block (i.e., the document body), and it is unaffected by scrolling. Absolutely positioned elements can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins.

### Sticky
Sticky is positioned based on the user's scroll position. A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
