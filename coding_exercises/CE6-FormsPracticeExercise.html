    Forms Practice Exercise
    Let's get some practice with forms, inputs, labels, and buttons! Write a simple form with the following inputs:

    Username

    Text Input

    Should have placeholder text of 'username'

    Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)

    Password

    Password Input

    Should have placeholder text of 'password'

    Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)

    A Button

    With the inner text 'Register'

    I added in some <div> elements for spacing, but you don't need to:
 -->

<section>
    <form>
        
        <div>
            <label for="username">Username</label>
            <input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="username"/>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <label for="password">Password</label>
            <input type="password" name="password" id="password" placeholder="password"/>
        </div>
        
        
        <button type="submit">Register</button>
        
        
        
    </form>
</section>
